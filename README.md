# DIY Fueling Calculator ‚Äì Ingredient Rationale

This calculator is built around evidence‚Äëbased fueling principles for endurance running.  
Here‚Äôs why each ingredient is included and how the amounts are set:

## ‚ö° Carbohydrates (2:1 ratio)
- **Maltodextrin (2 parts)**  
  Fast‚Äëabsorbing glucose source that provides steady energy without being overly sweet.  
  Forms the bulk of the fuel to keep the gel easy on the stomach.

- **Fructose (1 part)**  
  Absorbed through a different pathway than glucose, which allows your body to take in *more total carbs per hour* without gut distress.  
  The **2:1 maltodextrin:fructose ratio** is widely used in endurance fueling to maximize absorption.

## üçã Citric Acid
- Added in a very small amount for tartness and palatability.  
- Helps balance acidity so the gel tastes better over long hours.

## üßÇ Sodium (Table Salt)
- Critical for replacing sodium lost in sweat, maintaining fluid balance, and supporting muscle function.  
- The calculator targets **~300 mg sodium per 30 g carbs**, a common endurance guideline.  
- This means sodium scales automatically with your carb intake ‚Äî longer runs and larger athletes get proportionally more sodium.

### Why this setup?
- **Efficient absorption**: 2:1 carb ratio lets you fuel at higher rates without GI issues.  
- **Balanced electrolytes**: Sodium is tied to carb load, keeping hydration and fueling aligned.  
- **Palatable**: Citric acid improves taste without overwhelming the stomach.  
- **Cost‚Äëeffective**: DIY gels deliver the same fueling principles as commercial products at a fraction of the price.
